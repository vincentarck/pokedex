# Pokedex
Assesment for [Nusameta](https://nusameta.io/).

### Finished Requirements

- Create your own interface. Cleaner is better. ‚úÖ
- Create your own API endpoint using Next.js route handlers for fetching data from the Pok√©mon API. You can implement this route handler as middleware to shield our backend (Pok√©mon) API from exposure to browsers. For example, create a route handler containing a function to fetch Pok√©mon details, and the exposed API endpoint path will be: `<your_app_host>/api/pokemon/<id>`. On the client side, you can then fetch data from this API endpoint. All of this should be done within a single Next.js app. Please refer to the reference links below.‚úÖ 
- You can use any library to assist you with your assessment.‚úÖ

## What Are Nice to Have (Not Mandatory, but a Plus!)

- Implement Atomic Design principles. ‚ùå
- Use React Query for client-side data fetching. ‚úÖ
- Create a "Liked Pok√©mon" feature, allowing users to like/unlike (not dislike) any Pok√©mon they choose. Create a new page for "Liked Pok√©mon." You can save the liked Pok√©mon list using any state management library like React Context, Redux, or MobX. (Note: It's a BIG plus!) ‚úÖ
- Implement semantic HTML and maintain a clean code structure. ‚úÖ
- Deploy your application to Vercel! Perhaps someone "important" would like to see it live. ‚úÖ
