# Pokedex
Assesment for [Nusameta](https://nusameta.io/).

### Finished Requirements

- Create your own interface. Cleaner is better. ‚úÖ
- Create your own API endpoint using Next.js route handlers for fetching data from the Pok√©mon API. You can implement this route handler as middleware to shield our backend (Pok√©mon) API from exposure to browsers. For example, create a route handler containing a function to fetch Pok√©mon details, and the exposed API endpoint path will be: `<your_app_host>/api/pokemon/<id>`. On the client side, you can then fetch data from this API endpoint. All of this should be done within a single Next.js app. Please refer to the reference links below.‚úÖ 
- You can use any library to assist you with your assessment.‚úÖ

## What Are Nice to Have (Not Mandatory, but a Plus!)

- Implement Atomic Design principles. ‚ùå
- Use React Query for client-side data fetching. ‚úÖ
- Create a "Liked Pok√©mon" feature, allowing users to like/unlike (not dislike) any Pok√©mon they choose. Create a new page for "Liked Pok√©mon." You can save the liked Pok√©mon list using any state management library like React Context, Redux, or MobX. (Note: It's a BIG plus!) ‚úÖ
- Implement semantic HTML and maintain a clean code structure. ‚úÖ
- Deploy your application to Vercel! Perhaps someone "important" would like to see it live. ‚úÖ

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏èüî• by Vincent
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Performance Analyze
#### Main Page
I assume performance impacted because i dont fit intersection observer with screen, so it makes fetch bout 2 times bcs last card is visible in screen 
Or i have to transform data to get image and url pokemon

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
